## Summary

Over 5 years of experience in back-end and front-end development. Of these, approximately 2 years also include team leadership.

I have an Associate's Degree in Internet Systems (graduated in 2017) by [Universidade do Vale do Itajaí](https://univali.br).

I've worked as development coordinator in large scale projects with global impact, coordinating a team of developers on the maintenance and development of new features for legacy software.

I've also worked as lead developer in the software development for a medical field startup, where I've been in charge of leading a team of developers in the process of modelling and development of a web platform and Android & iOS apps.

Past experiences include maintaining and feature development for an accounting ERP and development of responsive websites for a web agency.

Self-taught, creative and gamer in my spare time.
